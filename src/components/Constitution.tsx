          We, the Developers of Next Advanced Technology (DONAT), the only ICT
          academic senior high school organization of STI College Ortigas-Cainta
          hereby fulfill its role as an open community for ICT students to

          education.

      <H2>ARTICLE I: GENERAL PROVISIONS</H2>
      <div>
        <P>
          <strong>Section 1.</strong> This Constitution and By-Laws shall be
          known as the Constitution and By-Laws of the DONAT: Developers of Next
          Advanced Technology of STI College Ortigas-Cainta Senior High School,
          and will contain information on DONAT's history, laws, and functions.
        </P>
      </div>

      <H2>ARTICLE II: OFFICIAL NAME AND LOGO </H2>
      <P>
        <strong>Section 1.</strong> The senior high school ICT academic
        organization shall be recognized as the Developers of Next Advanced
        Technology and shall be abbreviated as DONAT.
      </P>
      <P>
        <strong>Section 2.</strong> The name was inspired by the High-Level
        Programming Language - Java (where Java got its name from a coffee). The
        organization brainstormed in their first pre-meeting and looked for
        something fresh and wanted to avoid "nerdy names". It was contested to
        make it DONUT first when the acting representative for the organization
        got hungry, and the adviser warned the latter that no one is supposed to
        eat inside the classroom. The adviser made a joke that time by getting
        the same idea with the popular language, introducing the name DONUT. The
        letter "U" was changed to "A", as the term undiscovered and unidentified
        is somehow frightening to use, making it “A” that stands for Advanced.
      </P>
      <P>
        <strong>Section 3.</strong> The Logo gained its inspiration from the
        Java programming language and got its idea from the well-known pastry
        “doughnut” or most referred to as "donut". The logo resembles a
        donut-shape with the compliment design of a gear-liked structure as part
        of the logo that shows the “Technological Advancement”, filled with
        different sprinkles that represent different fields in IT including
        programming, hardware and troubleshooting, Graphical Designs, and
        Research and Development. The middle hole represents a loop of unending
        learning of the Aspiring Junior Programmers.
      </P>
      <P>
        <strong>Section 4.</strong> The redesigned logo consists of colors and
        shapes that have significant meanings that correlate highly with the
        objectives of aspiring developers, designers, and researchers. The
        purple base color expresses the nurturing wisdom of senior high school
        students in computer programming. Also, it portrays the creativity of
        learners who yearn to be professionals in graphics and design. Thus, it
        represents researchers' power when acquiring knowledge through intensive
        studies. The dough has a brown color that symbolizes the strength and
        reliability of the sturdy foundation of DONAT officers and members. Each
        class is represented by different figures; Ciphers have a triangle shape
        in which the sharp edges portray the programmer's keen eyes for coding.
        Prober has a circle structure depicting that a study is a full loop
        because every research leads to a new question. Munchkin has a square
        figure that has equal sides that can relate to balance and harmony which
        every artist should possess.
      </P>
